## Introduction

Hello, I'm cirro! I'm 17, go by he/they, and like computers. I co-own MadHouse Labs, a developer conglomerate and friend group with over 70 members. I'm also a web designer, backend developer, and ~~pretend~~ sysadmin.

## Backstory

I first started programming around the age of 11, making bad Roblox cheats and miscellaneous Windows applications. I quickly moved to Discord userbots, regluar bots, and then finally at backend development. This is when I expressed interest in Web APIs. My first notable web project was a file hosting service, compatible with ShareX. After that, I made multiple REST APIs for data storage in old Roblox clients, which then was the catalyst for my interest in system administration. When I started to experiment with making my file uploader look _just a bit prettier_, I realized _just how important_ a good UI is, and how it can completely change the feel of a website. I'll be honest; I never really touched vanilla CSS from the get-go. Tailwind CSS has been an absolute treat to work with, and still gives me the flexibility to create what I actually want.
